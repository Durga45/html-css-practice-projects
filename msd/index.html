          <h2>MSD-captain cool</h2>
          <p>
            Regarded as one of the greatest captains of all time, the legendary
            <b>MS Dhoni</b> celebrates his 40th birthday on July 07, 2021. Dhoni hung
            up his boots from international cricket last year but continues to
            lead Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League. Despite his
            retirement, he remains one of the most talked-about cricketers in
            the world. Dhoni enjoyed an illustrious career with Team India
            filled with some glorious victories across different parts of the
            world. He holds the record for most matches as a captain across
            formats and is the only captain to have won all three major ICC
            limited-overs trophies - <b>ODI World Cup (2011)</b>, <b>T20 World Cup (2007)</b>,
            and <b>Champions Trophy (2013)</b>. Apart from being a brilliant
            wicket-keeper and one of the most reliable finishers, Dhoni was an
            exceptional leader. His sharp instincts coupled with his astute mind
            and amazing game awareness made him a street-smart captain, who
            liked staying ahead of his opposition in crunch situations. Dhoni
            achieved numerous laurels during his captaincy stint with India and
            led the team to some of the most memorable victories. On his 40th
            birthday, we take a look at the five greatest achievements of the
            former Indian captain which every Indian will be proud of.
